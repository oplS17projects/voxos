# Voxos - 2D Side Scroller Game - Bill Bobos & Anthony Voloshin


### Statement

Voxos is a 2D side scrolling game developed in Racket. It uses the Draw, Mode-Lambda, and Rsound libraries.
It's a fun way to explore a real world project using Racket, functional programming, and data abstraction.
We hope to learn real-world applications of the lessons learned in class.

### Analysis

- Data abstraction will be used for the environment, player, enemies, and sound
- Recursion will be used in sound and music rendering, sound processing, and other sound events
- Map, filter, and reduce will be used primarily with enemy, and environmental objects to process effects, and game events
- Object orientation will be used for the environment, player, and enemies
- State modification will be used with to manage the player and enemy states

### External Technologies

- We will interact with a graphics database that stores sprites
- We are generating and processing sound effects and music

### Data Sets or other Source Materials

- We will be using new art source material created by Bill
- We will be using new sound source material created by Bill
- We will externally sourced music
- All existing data we need is easily converted using web based tools

### Deliverable and Demonstration

- At the end of the project we hope to have a playable level with sound effects and music
- The game will be interactive and playable

### Evaluation of Results

- We are successful if we can manage to create a functional demo
- A functional demo that includes player movement, environment interaction, and player interaction

## Architecture Diagram

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Play Environment will be a sprite created by Bill which will then be mapped onto a cylindrical render layer using mode-lambda and racket/draw. This sprite will then be continuously rotated by updating its stored theta value to achieve a scrolling effect. A separate layer will be populated with the various other sprites in the game, such as the player, projectiles, and enemies. The sprite objects in the game will all be loaded and arranged on layers by mode-lamba and drawn on-screen by racket-draw. All the while, sound effects and music will be played using rsound. 

## Schedule

### First Milestone (Sun Apr 9)

- We want to have a functioning environment - either static or scrolling
- This will include interfacing with Bill's artwork
- Bill's functioning external sprite database
- Bill's placeholder environmental artwork
- Bill's placeholder player artwork

### Second Milestone (Sun Apr 16)

- We want to have functioning player movement
- We want functional player interaction
- Bill's additional artwork compiled into sprite database
- We want to introduce enemy and other assorted objects into the environment

### Public Presentation (Mon Apr 24, Wed Apr 26, or Fri Apr 28)

- We want to incorporate interactive functionality between the player and enemies
- Bill finishing up all remaining sprite objects
- Bill incorporating sound into objects
- Bill incorporating music into the demo
