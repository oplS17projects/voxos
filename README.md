# Voxos - 2D Side Scroller Game - Bill Bobos & Anthony Voloshin


### Statement

Voxos is a 2D side scrolling game developed in Racket. It uses the Draw, Mode-Lambda, and Rsound libraries.
It's a fun way to explore a real world project using Racket, functional programming, and data abstraction.
We hope to learn real-world applications of the lessons learned in class.

### Analysis

- Data abstraction will be used for the environment, player, enemies, and sound
- Recursion will be used in sound and music rendering, sound processing, and other sound events
- Map, filter, and reduce will be used primarily with enemy, and environmental objects to process effects, and game events
- Object orientation will be used for the environment, player, and enemies
- State modification will be used with to manage the player and enemy states

### External Technologies

- We will interact with a graphics database that stores sprites
- We are generating and processing sound effects and music

### Data Sets or other Source Materials

- We will be using new art source material created by Bill
- We will be using new sound source material created by Bill
- We will externally sourced music
- All existing data we need is easily converted using web based tools

### Deliverable and Demonstration

- At the end of the project we hope to have a playable level with sound effects and music
- The game will be interactive and playable

### Evaluation of Results

- We are successful if we can manage to create a functional demo
- A functional demo that includes player movement, environment interaction, and player interaction

## Architecture Diagram

- Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

- Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Schedule

### First Milestone (Sun Apr 9)

- We want to have a functioning environment - either static or scrolling
- This will include interfacing with Bill's artwork
- Bill's functioning external sprite database
- Bill's placeholder environmental artwork
- Bill's placeholder player artwork

### Second Milestone (Sun Apr 16)

- We want to have functioning player movement
- We want functional player interaction
- Bill's additional artwork compiled into sprite database
- We want to introduce enemy and other assorted objects into the environment

### Public Presentation (Mon Apr 24, Wed Apr 26, or Fri Apr 28)

- We want to incorporate interactive functionality between the player and enemies
- Bill finishing up all remaining sprite objects
- Bill incorporating sound into objects
- Bill incorporating music into the demo
