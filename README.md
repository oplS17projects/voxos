# Voxos - 2D Side Scroller Game - Bill Bobos

### Statement

Voxos is a 2D side scrolling game developed in Racket. It uses the Lux, Mode-Lambda, and Rsound libraries.
It's a fun way to explore a real world project using Racket, functional programming, and data abstraction.
I learned real-world applications of the lessons learned in class.

### Analysis

- Data abstraction was used for the environment, player, enemies, and sound
- Recursion was used in graphics, events, sound and music rendering, sound processing, and other events
- Filter was used primarily with enemy, and environmental objects to process effects, and game events
- State modification was used with to manage the player and enemy states

### External Technologies

- I interacted with a graphics database that stores sprites
- I generated and processing sound effects and music

### Data Sets or other Source Materials

- I created all new art source material
- I created all new sound effects source material
- I used externally sourced music
- All existing data I need was easily converted using web based tools

### Deliverable and Demonstration

- At the end of the project I have a playable level with graphics, sound effects, and music
- The game is interactive and playable

### Evaluation of Results

- I am successful in creating a functional game
- The functional game includes player movement, and player interaction
